    Simply input an ingredient, a unit to convert from, a unit to convert to, and a quantity. The result will update instantly as you change any of the inputs.

    <h2 style="margin: 8px 0px 8px 0px;">How does the ingredient converter work?</h2>
    Ingredient conversion works differently depending on what units you are converting between.
    <br>
    <br>
    There are three basic cases to consider:
    <ul>
        <li>Converting between different units of weight</li>
        <li>Converting between different units of volume</li>
        <li>Converting between weight and volume</li>
    </ul>
    All three cases are outlined below.

<div class="content">
    <h4 style="margin: 8px 0px 8px 0px;">Converting between different units of weight</h4>
    Different units of weight are related to each other by a ratio. For example, a kilogram is exactly 1000 grams.
    That means that in order to convert kilograms to gram, we simply multiply the value by 1000.
    <br>
    <br>
    In general, for each combination of units of weight that we want to convert between we need to know their ratio.
    After that, it is just a simple matter of multiplication.
    <br>
    <br>

<div class="content">
    <h4 style="margin: 8px 0px 8px 0px;">Converting between different units of volume</h4>
    Similar to units of weights, units of volume are also related to each other by a simple ratio. For example, one
    liter is about 4.227 US cups.
    <br>
    <br>
    If you would like to know the ratios for all the units of volume found in the converter you may explore the <a
        href="volumes.html">volumes table</a>.
    <br>
    <br>

<div class="content">
    <h4 style="margin: 8px 0px 8px 0px;">Converting between weight and volume</h4>
    Conversion between weight and volume is a bit more involved as there is not a simple ratio that can convert
    between units of weight and volume. We must instead know the density of the ingredient we wish to convert.
    <br>
    <br>
    The density, typically denoted by the greek letter ρ (rho), is defined as mass divided by volume. This can be
    expressed as an equation: ρ = m / V. Weight, in the context of cooking, is the same as mass*.
    <br>
    <br>
    Using the equation, we can calculate the mass as m = ρ · V, and volume as V = m / ρ. Just like weight and
    volume, density has to be expressed in units, for examples grams per milliliter or g/ml.
    <br>
    <br>
    Say that we want to convert 1kg of all purpose flour into US cups. Assume that we know the density of flour is
    0.53 g/ml. First we convert 1kg into 1000g. Using the formula we see that V = 1000g / (0.53 g/ml) which gives us
    1886.792... ml. From our table of volumes we see that 1 ml is roughly 0.00423 US cups. 1886.792 · 0.00423 ≈
    7.98.
    <br>
    <br>
    All that work just to find out that 1kg of all purpose flour is 7.98 US cups. Luckily the converter will do this
    automatically for you if you just pick the units and quantity.
    <br>
    <br>
    What if you want to convert volume to weight? Say 1 US cup of flour to kg? We use our volumes table to find out
    that 1 US cup is roughly 236.588 ml. The equation gives us that m = (0.53 g/ml) · 236.588, that is 125.392
    grams. Multiplying by 1000 as per our weights table and rounding the results gives us 0.125kg.

    <div style="font-size: 10px;">(*In physics, weight denotes the force of gravity acting upon an object and is
        calculated by multiplying the mass by the graviational acceleration. However, in cooking we use weight to
        simply refer to mass. For more information please checkout <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight"
