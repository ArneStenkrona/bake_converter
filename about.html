          This is a simple web app for baking unit conversion. I've made it with the intent of being as simple as possible with no unnecessary distractions. 
        <br>
        <br>
        While many sites with the same purpose exists, I've personally found them cumbersome to use with needlessly many subpages. I often find myself having to navigate to a volume to weight section only to backtrack once I need weight to volume. And if I suddenly want to convert flour instead of sugar I have to search for a completely different page. Why not just have all ingredients and units in one simple place? Baking is already challenging enough as it is!

        If you like this site feel free to share it! Hopefully it will help you and your friends focus more on the delicious stuff you make and less on clicking through a dozen links until you find the right units to convert.
