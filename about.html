<h4 style="margin: 8px 0px 8px 0px;">What is this site?</h4>
This is a simple web app for baking unit conversion. I've made it with the intent of being as simple
as possible with no unnecessary distractions.

I'm a baking enthusiast who often find myself converting units. I found most sites available online to be cumbersome
and confusing. This site is hopefully a more comfortable alternative.
